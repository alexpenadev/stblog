      <p>
        <em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood
        here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the
        exploration of the universe revealed by science. It's time to get going
        again. We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the
        infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant
        future. We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity
        waves of space-time, encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore
        the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns
        and universes smaller than atoms

      <h3>COSMOS IS A STORY ABOUT US</h3>

      <p>
        It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found
        their way to the stars, one adventure with many heroes. To make this
        journey, we'll need imagination. But imagination alone is not enough
        because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can
        imagine. This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers
        strictly adhering to a simple set of rules test ideas by experiment and
        observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones
        that fail, follow the evidence wherever it leads and question
        everything.
        <strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>
